# Introduction

**openradtool** ("**ort**") translates a data model (data layout and
operations) into C, SQL ([SQLite3](https://sqlite.org)), and
TypeScript/JavaScript code.  It also has a raft of related features,
such as role-based access control, auditing, full documentation of
generated sources, etc.

There's nothing in **ort** that's specific to C or SQLite.  This is
simply what I currently use as output.

The generated files currently use
[sqlbox(3)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/sqlbox) to wrap around SQLite and
(optionally) [kcgi(3)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi) for JSON or
validation output.

**ort requires the newest library versions to operate**:  all of these
tools are built in tandem.

Why is **ort** handy?  It removes a lot of "boilerplate" code querying
the database and allocating objects.  Some additional features:

- Functions generated for modifying (updates), allocating (inserts), and
  accessing (queries).
- Automagic foreign key "INNER JOIN" when accessing structures.
  The configuration specifies nested structures and **ort** creates the
  "join" functionality when querying for those objects.
- Several types of accessors: iterator-based (function callback),
  list-based (queue), and unique (selecting on unique fields).
- Well-formed, readable C and SQL output describing functions (if
  applicable), variables, structures, and so on.
- "Difference calculator" between configuration files helps database
  updates be reasonable by providing the necessary "ALTER TABLE" and so
  on to help with versioning.  (Also protects against accidental
  incompatible changes.)
- Beyond the usual native type support (int, text, real, blob), also
  supports "password" type that has automatic hashing mechanism built-in
  during selection from and insertion into the database.
- Several different types of SQL query (and update and delete)
  operators.
- Optional JSON output functions.
- Optional JSON input functions.
- Optional field validation ([kcgi(3)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi))
  functions.
- Well-documented JavaScript or TypeScript handling of the JSON output
  generator.
- Role-based access control enforced by process separation.
- Auditing of role-based access control.

See the [TODO](TODO.md) for what still needs to be done.

This repository mirrors the main repository on
[BSD.lv](https://www.bsd.lv).  **ort** is still under development!

# Installation

**ort** runs best on OpenBSD, since this system offers the most
comprehensive security.  Why is this significant?  With OpenBSD,
processes may stipulate resource constraints effectively making them
unable to change their running environment: for example, an application
process may disable the facility to read files after spawning the
database process.  This effectively walls away the database from the
application.

The sources generated by **ort** will also work on Linux, FreeBSD, and
Mac OSX.

If your operating system doesn't already have **ort** bundled as a
third-party system, simply download and run the usual `./configure` and
`doas make install`.
