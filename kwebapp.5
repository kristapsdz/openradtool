.Sh NAME
.Nm kwebapp
.Nd syntax for kwebapp configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration is used by
.Xr kwebapp 1
to generate C source and header files that drive a database.
It is a free-form (white-space is not significant beyond separating
tokens) configuration language with the following rough structure:
.Bd -literal
[ "struct" structname 
  "{"
    [ "field" fieldname [ type [ typeinfo ] ] ";" ]+
  "}"
]+
.Ed
.Pp
In simple language, one or more structure definitions, each containing
one or more fields.
A
.Dq structure
is a database table or C struct; whereas a
.Dq field
is a column or a struct member.
The names of structures and fields must be case-sensitive alphanumeric
strings starting with a letter.
.Ss Structure
A structure maps into a C structure or a database table.
Their definitions begin with the word
.Li struct ,
then the name of the structure, then a set of definitions within the
curly braces.
.Pp
At this time, the set of structure definitions is limited to fields.
.Ss Field
A field defines a C structure member and/or a database column.
Each field consists of the word
.Li field
followed by a field name and type.
The type may be one of
.Li struct ,
.Li int ,
or
.Li text .
.Pp
The latter two will map into 64-bit integers and character strings.
The former is considered a foreign key reference, and has the syntax of
.Li source:target ,
where
.Li target
is the foreign target with syntax
.Li structure.field
and
.Li source
is the name of the field in the current structure.
This accomodates for joining tables; or in C terms, one structure
referring to another structure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A simple session table is as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct user {
  field name text;
  field id;
}
struct session { 
  field user struct userid:user.id;
  field userid;
  field token;
  field id;
}
.Ed
.Pp
This generates two C structures,
.Li user
and
.Li session ,
consisting of the given fields.
The
.Li session
structure contains a
.Li struct user
as well; thus, there is a declarative order that
.Xr kwebapp 1
enforces when writing out structures.
.Pp
The SQL interface, when fetching a
.Li struct session ,
will employ an
.Li INNER JOIN
over the user identifier and session
.Li userid
field.
