.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library parses
.Xr ort 5
configuration files.
The most common usage is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
create a configuration with
.Xr ort_config_alloc 3
.It
parse one or multiple files with
.Xr ort_parse_file 3
.It
finalise the configuration with
.Xr ort_parse_close 3
.It
manipulate the configuration
.It
free the configuration with
.Xr ort_config_free 3
.El
.Pp
To compile applications with
.Nm ,
include the
.Pa ort.h
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/queue.h>
#include <stdio.h> /* FILE */
#include <ort.h>
.Ed
.Pp
To compile and link, use
.Xr pkg-config 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% cc `pkg-config --cflags ort` -c -o sample.o sample.c
% cc -o sample sample.o `pkg-config --libs ort`
.Ed
.Ss Pledge Promises
The
.Nm
library is built to operate in security-sensitive environments, including
.Xr pledge 2
on
.Ox .
The only promise required is
.Qq stdio .
.Sh DATA STRUCTURES
In this documentation, all structures ending in
.Qq q ,
such as
.Qq struct bitidxq ,
are represented as tail-queue macros in
.In sys/queue.h .
.Pp
The central structure of
.Nm ort
is
.Vt struct config ,
which represents one or more configuration files.
It is allocated with
.Xr ort_config_alloc 3 ,
filled with
.Xr ort_parse_file 3 ,
and finalised with
.Xr ort_parse_close 3 .
It must be freed with
.Xr ort_config_free 3 .

.El
.Pp
The data of
.Vt struct strct
is defined by its queue of
.Vt struct field .
It may be represented as a column in an SQL table, a field of a C
structure, or a member of a JavaScript object.

.Dv FIELD_NOEXPORT
if the field may not be exported ever, and
.Dv FIELD_HASDEF

.El
.Pp
References are a central part of
.Nm
and allow fields to link to other fields.
These are governed by
.Vt "struct ref"
in
.Vt "struct field" .
Any field not of type
.Dv FTYPE_STRUCT
may link to any other field in another structure that has the same type.
This is called a foreign reference.
Fields with the special
.Dv FTYPE_STRUCT
type have a reference that points to a foreign reference in the same
structure.
This is called a local reference.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va struct field *target
For both local and remote references, this is the field in the linked-to
structure.
.It Va struct field *source
For remote references, this is the same as
.Fa parent .
For local references, this is the field in the current structure that's
the remote reference.
.It Va struct field *parent
The field upon which the reference is set.
.El
.Pp
Validation allows constraining the data accepted for native types, i.e., not
.Cm enum
or
.Cm bits .
A
.Vt struct field
may contain zero or more validation statements in
.Va fvq :
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va enum vtype type
The constrained inequality type.
For numeric types, the inequality compares by value.
For string types, the comparison is by string length.
.It Va <anon union> d.value
An anonymous union containing a value depending upon the
.Va type
of the parent
.Vt struct field .
If of type
.Dv FTYPE_BIT ,
.Dv FTYPE_BITFIELD ,
.Dv FTYPE_DATE ,
.Dv FTYPE_EPOCH ,
or
.Dv FTYPE_INT ,
this is
.Va int64_t integer ;
if
.Dv FTYPE_REAL ,
this is
.Va double decimal ;
otherwise, it is
.Va size_t len .
.El
.Pp
Unique data is stipulated on a per-field basis with
.Dv FIELD_UNIQUE
or using
.Vt struct unique
for the concatenation of multiple fields.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va struct nrefq nq
A queue whose objects consist primarily of
.Va field ,
a field in the unique set.
.It Va struct strct *parent
The encompassing structure.
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.El
.Ss User-defined Data Types
The data in
.Vt "struct field"
may be typed as an enumeration or bit-field, both of which are defined
within the configuration.
In short, both of these limit the integers accepted to those defined as
enumeration values or bit masks.
.Pp
The user-defined enumerations in
.Va eq
limit integer types to specific values.
Its
.Vt struct enm
is defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the enumeration.
It is unique (case insensitive) among all enumerations and bit-fields.
.It Va char *doc
If not
.Dv NULL ,
free-form documentation.
May be empty.
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.It Va struct eitemq eq
Non-empty list of all enumeration values.
.El
.Pp
Each enumeration has a non-empty list of
.Vt struct eitem
that define the enumeration's values.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the enumeration item.
It is unique (case insensitive) among other items in the enumeration.
.It Va int64_t value
The value less than
.Dv INT64_MAX
and greater than
.Dv INT64_MIN .
It is unique among other items in the enumeration.
.It Va char *doc
If not
.Dv NULL ,
free-form documentation.
May be empty.
.It Va struct labelq labels
A possibly-empty list of exported labels describing the item.
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.It Va struct enm *parent
The encompassing enumeration.
.It Va unsigned int flags
Flags.
May be set to
.Dv EITEM_AUTO
if the
.Va value
was assigned dynamically.
Dynamic assignment occurs after parsing and works by taking the maximum
assigned value (bound below at zero), adding one, then assigning and
adding one in the order of declaration.
.El
.Pp
The label queue of
.Vt struct label
is exported, so its contents must be considered public.
It consists of names for each item.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *label
The non-empty free-form label.
It may not contain the
.Qq <
left right-angle bracket.
.It Va size_t lang
Language index in
.Va lang
of
.Vt struct config .

If not
.Dv NULL ,
free-form documentation.
May be empty.
.It Va struct labelq labels
A possibly-empty list of exported labels for formatting the bit.
.It Va int64_t values
The bit itself inclusive of 0\(en63.
.It Va struct bitf *parent
The parent bit-field structure.
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.El
.Pp
User-based types all have text representations of their numeric values.
These labels may be assigned in any number of languages.
All languages are defined in the
.Va char **langs
array in
.Vt struct config .
Labels are defined in queues of type
.Vt "struct label"
in all user-defined types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *label
The label in natural language.
This is commonly in UTF-8, although there are no restrictions except
that the string be non-empty and NUL-terminated in the usual way.
.It Va size_t lang
The language as indexed into
.Va char **langs
in
.Vt struct config .
.El
.Ss Role-based Access Control
The role-based access control of the system is defined by
.Vt struct role .
If the
.Va rq
queue in the top-level
.Vt struct config
is empty, there are no roles defined.
(This should not change a generated API.)
Roles are hierarchical, so the roles in
.Vt struct config
are top-level roles.
Roles inherit the operations (defined by
.Vt struct rolemap )
available to the parent.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the role.
It is unique (case insensitive) among other roles.
.It Va char *doc
If not
.Dv NULL ,
free-form documentation.
May be empty.
.It Va struct role *parent
The parent role.
If
.Dv NULL ,
this is a top-level role.
.It Va struct roleq subrq
A possibly-empty queue of inheriting roles.
These use the
.Va entries
queue macro variable.

.El
.Pp
One or more role are assigned to operations or data with
.Vt struct rolemap .
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent

The non-empty roles that are to be assigned.
Roles are hierarchical, so each role's descendents are implicitly mapped
to the given operation as well.
.It Va enum rolemapt type
The type of operation to be assigned.
This may be one of
.Dv ROLEMAP_ALL ,
which is an alias for all types

.Dv ROLEMAP_LIST ,
and
.Dv ROLEMAP_SEARCH
for queries;
.Dv ROLEMAP_DELETE

The structure for which the assignment is applicable.
.It Va struct field *f
If
.Dv ROLEMAP_NOEXPORT ,
the field that shouldn't be exported.
.It Va struct search *s
If
.Dv ROLEMAP_COUNT ,
.Dv ROLEMAP_ITERATE ,
.Dv ROLEMAP_LIST ,
or
.Dv ROLEMAP_SEARCH ,

Parent containing the operation.
.It Va struct rolemap *rolemap
If not
.Dv NULL ,
roles allowed to perform the operation.
.It Va unsigned int flags
Set to
.Dv UPDATE_ALL
if the operation is an update and all modifier fields were specified by
leaving the modifier field empty during configuration.
.El
.Pp
Fields by which operations are constrained or modified are defined in
.Vt struct uref :

.It Va struct rolemap *rolemap
If not
.Dv NULL ,
roles allowed to perform insertions.
.It Va struct strct *parent
Parent containing the insertion.

(That is, it queries unique values.)
.El
.Pp
Search parameters are listed in a queue of

The queue may have multiple parameters of the same
.Fa field ,
as there may be multiple ways of indirecting to the same field.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.It Va struct search *parent
The encompassing search component.
.It Va struct field *field

when a system error has occurred.
.It Va char *buf
This is the message contents or
.Dv NULL ,
usually used in conjunction with
.Va er .
If both
.Va buf
and
