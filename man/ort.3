.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library parses
.Xr ort 5
configuration files.
The most common usage is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
create a configuration with
.Xr ort_config_alloc 3
.It
parse one or multiple files with
.Xr ort_parse_file 3
.It
finalise the configuration with
.Xr ort_parse_close 3
.It
manipulate the configuration
.It
free the configuration with
.Xr ort_config_free 3
.El
.Pp
To compile applications with
.Nm ,
include the
.Pa ort.h
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/queue.h>
#include <stdio.h> /* FILE */
#include <ort.h>
.Ed
.Pp
To compile and link, use
.Xr pkg-config 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% cc `pkg-config --cflags ort` -c -o sample.o sample.c
% cc -o sample sample.o `pkg-config --libs ort`
.Ed
.Ss Pledge Promises
The
.Nm
library is built to operate in security-sensitive environments, including
.Xr pledge 2
on
.Ox .
The only promise required is
.Qq stdio .
.Sh DATA STRUCTURES
In this documentation, all structures ending in
.Qq q ,
such as
.Qq struct bitidxq ,
are represented as tail-queue macros in
.In sys/queue.h .
.Pp
The central structure of
.Nm ort
is
.Vt struct config ,
which represents one or more configuration files.
It is allocated with
.Xr ort_config_alloc 3 ,
filled with
.Xr ort_parse_file 3 ,
and finalised with
.Xr ort_parse_close 3 .
It must be freed with
.Xr ort_config_free 3 .

.El
.Pp
The data of
.Vt struct strct

.Dv FIELD_NOEXPORT
if the field may not be exported ever, and
.Dv FIELD_HASDEF

.El
.Pp
References are a central part of
.Nm
and allow fields to link to other fields.
These are governed by
.Vt "struct ref"
in
.Vt "struct field" .
Any field not of type
.Dv FTYPE_STRUCT
may link to any other field in another structure that has the same type.
This is called a foreign reference.
Fields with the special
.Dv FTYPE_STRUCT
type have a reference that points to a foreign reference in the same
structure.
This is called a local reference.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va struct field *target
For both local and remote references, this is the field in the linked-to
structure.
.It Va struct field *source
For remote references, this is the same as
.Fa parent .
For local references, this is the field in the current structure that's
the remote reference.
.It Va struct field *parent
The field upon which the reference is set.
.El
.Pp
Validation allows constraining the data accepted for native types, i.e., not
.Cm enum
or
.Cm bits .
A
.Vt struct field
may contain zero or more validation statements in
.Va fvq :
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va enum vtype type
The constrained inequality type.
For numeric types, the inequality compares by value.
For string types, the comparison is by string length.
.It Va <anon union> d.value
An anonymous union containing a value depending upon the
.Va type
of the parent
.Vt struct field .
If of type
.Dv FTYPE_BIT ,
.Dv FTYPE_BITFIELD ,
.Dv FTYPE_DATE ,
.Dv FTYPE_EPOCH ,
or
.Dv FTYPE_INT ,
this is
.Va int64_t integer ;
if
.Dv FTYPE_REAL ,
this is
.Va double decimal ;
otherwise, it is
.Va size_t len .
.El
.Pp

.Dv FIELD_UNIQUE
or using
.Vt struct unique
for the concatenation of multiple fields.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va struct nrefq nq

.Va field ,
a field in the unique set.
The queue is ordered in by the case-insensitive name (a\(enz) of the
field.
.It Va struct strct *parent
The encompassing structure.
.It Va struct pos pos
Parse position.
.El
.Ss User-defined Data Types
The data in
.Vt "struct field"
may be typed as an enumeration or bit-field, both of which are defined
within the configuration.
In short, both of these limit the integers accepted to those defined as
enumeration values or bit masks.
.Pp
The user-defined enumerations in
.Va eq
limit integer types to specific values.
Its
.Vt struct enm
is defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the enumeration.
It is unique (case insensitive) among all enumerations and bit-fields.
.It Va char *doc
If not
.Dv NULL ,

.Pp
Each enumeration has a non-empty list of
.Vt struct eitem
that define the enumeration's values.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the enumeration item.
It is unique (case insensitive) among other items in the enumeration.
.It Va int64_t value

Parse position.
.It Va struct enm *parent
The encompassing enumeration.
.It Va unsigned int flags
Flags.
May be set to
.Dv EITEM_AUTO
if the
.Va value
was assigned dynamically.
Dynamic assignment occurs after parsing and works by taking the maximum
assigned value (bound below at zero), adding one, then assigning and
adding one in the order of declaration.
.El
.Pp
The label queue of
.Vt struct label
is exported, so its contents must be considered public.
It consists of names for each item.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *label
The non-empty free-form label.
It may not contain the
.Qq <
left right-angle bracket.

Parse position.
.El
.Pp
User-based types all have text representations of their numeric values.
These labels may be assigned in any number of languages.
All languages are defined in the
.Va char **langs
array in
.Vt struct config .
Labels are defined in queues of type
.Vt "struct label"
in all user-defined types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent

The language as indexed into
.Va char **langs
in
.Vt struct config .
.El
.Ss Role-based Access Control
The role-based access control of the system is defined by
.Vt struct role .
If the
.Va rq
queue in the top-level
.Vt struct config
is empty, there are no roles defined.
(This should not change a generated API.)
Roles are hierarchical, so the roles in
.Vt struct config
are top-level roles.
Roles inherit the operations (defined by
.Vt struct rolemap )
available to the parent.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Va char *name
The non-empty name of the role.
It is unique (case insensitive) among other roles.

.Pp
One or more role are assigned to operations or data with
.Vt struct rolemap .
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent

Roles are hierarchical, so each role's descendents are implicitly mapped
to the given operation as well.
.It Va enum rolemapt type
The type of operation to be assigned.
This may be one of
.Dv ROLEMAP_ALL ,
which is an alias for all types

.Dv ROLEMAP_LIST ,
and
.Dv ROLEMAP_SEARCH
for queries;
.Dv ROLEMAP_DELETE

.It Va struct rolemap *rolemap
If not
.Dv NULL ,
roles allowed to perform the operation.
.It Va unsigned int flags
Set to
.Dv UPDATE_ALL
if the operation is an update and all modifier fields were specified by
leaving the modifier field empty during configuration.
.El
.Pp
Fields by which operations are constrained or modified are defined in

Messages are generated by parsing, linking, and front-end formatting to
indicate some sort of bad condition.
These messages are accumulated in
.Vt struct config
and should be reported to the operator.
They are represented by
.Vt struct msg .

.It Va char *fname
Filename where message occurred or
.Dv NULL .
.It Va size_t line
Line number where message occurred or zero if not associated.
.It Va size_t column
Line column where message occurred or zero if not associated.
.It Va enum msgtype type
A message that is either
.Dv MSGTYPE_WARN
for a message that may be ignored,
.Dv MSGTYPE_ERROR
when a parse/format sequence should be stopped due to errors, or
.Dv MSGTYPE_FATAL
when a system error has occurred.
.It Va char *buf
